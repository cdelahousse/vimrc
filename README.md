# My .vimrc

My .vimrc and all the settings I've accrued since 2010. It is extensive and well
documented.

## Clean Install

1. Clone this repo `~/.vim`. Vim's default `vimrc` runtime path should include `~/.vim/vimrc`.

    $> `git clone git://github.com/cdelahousse/vimrc.git ~/.vim`

1. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) package manager.

1. Open vim to get vim-plug to download all the extensions into ~/.vim/plugged

    :PlugInstall
