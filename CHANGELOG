*	Updated the readme

* Changed mappings, added tmux specific functionality

2013-01-03 
* (vundle settings) : I removed nerdtree. I want to use netrw instead.
See http://vimcasts.org/episodes/the-file-explorer/

* (Mappings for interesting func.) : removed jj,kk, kj, etc.. mapping b/c of
what the manual calls ambiguous mappings. Slows down text insertion.
Created <leader>sx, <leader>sg toggle for changing between tmux and the normal
terminal
